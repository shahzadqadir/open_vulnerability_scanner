# Open Vulnerability Scanner

Scan Cisco devices for vulnerabilities and offer fixes using Cisco OpenVuln API.

### Project Idea:

Currently working on it. Idea is to develop a webapp that can take either an IOS version or IP address of connected device(s) and using Cisco OpenVuln API pull the information about vulnerabilities. Then it will connect to device and figure out which vulnerabilities are relevant to that device based on its configurations. It will also suggest fixes (at least in some cases!) and offer to apply fixes.
